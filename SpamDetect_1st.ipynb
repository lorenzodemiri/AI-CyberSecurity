    "![AI neuron](resources\\AiNeuron.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanism that transform the input data into an output value is implemented by making use of appropriate weighing of the the values of an input, wich are summarized to an activate function wich, when exceeding a certain threshold,produces a value of output that is forwarded to the remaining components of the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## We have to find the right weight!\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the stastical models and AI algorithms is that the algorithms implement an optimization strategy based on iteration, for each iteration, the algo tries to adjust the estimate of the values, giving to them a bigger or lower weight depending on the cost that function that we have to minimize. The scope of the algo is to find an optimal weight to estimate values in order to obtain rielable future predictions on unknown future data."

    "Imagine that we are going to separete our emails by categorizing them based on the presence ro the absence of certain keywords that occurs in our emails witha certain frequency. To do this we can list on table all the incoming emails and after running the AI function giving them a tag to classify them by two paramenters **HAM** or **SPAM**.\n",

    "We will identify a threshold value that allows us to separate smap messages. If the score exceeds the threshold value, the mail will be classified as SPAM if not as HAM.\n",
    "The threshold  value will be constantly updated to take into account the new series of spam emails that we will receive in future. "
