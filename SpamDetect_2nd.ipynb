    "# Spam detection with SVMs\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs are a type of **supervised** algorithms wich has the task to find the best hyperplane that best separet classes of data that can be represente in a  **multidimesional space**. In some cases we can have data that needs different hyperplanes to correctly separate the data from each other, in our case we have to choose an hyperplane that **optimizes the prefixed margin**, that rapresent the distance between the hyperplane and the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVM can be considered as a better implementation of Perceptron. The key difference is that on the Perceptron we have tried to **minimize** classifications errors, in the SVM instead is to maximiza the margin, wich is the distance between the hyperplane and the *closest* training data to the hyperplane(know as **support vector**).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The optimization strategy of SVMs\n",
    "By choosing the **wider margins** correspond to fewer classifications errors, while with **narrower margins** we risk incurring the phenomenon known as **overfitting**(we will discuss it later)\n",
    "\n",
    "So now let's translate the SVM into mathematical terms, similar to what we done in the case of Perceptron, "
